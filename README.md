# Risk Register
<h3>  Overview</h3>
<hr>
<p>Welcome to my "Risk Register" Google Cybersecurity Certification Project, where the Risk Assessment and Prioritization System serves as a vital component within the cybersecurity framework implemented at a commercial bank. As part of this system, cybersecurity professionals evaluate and prioritize potential risks to the bank's operational environment. By assessing the likelihood and severity of each risk, the team aims to create a risk register that guides resource allocation and risk mitigation efforts</p>
